The plaintexts have no spaces, only a - z encoded as
0,0,0,0,0, to 1,1,0,0,1,  
The keystream is the repetition of an English keyword or phrase,
encoded the same way (only a - z).
The ciphertext consists of the keystream XORed with the plaintext.
Each ciphertext comes from a different keystream.

The file pairs.txt shows which pairs of letters XOR to a give 5-bit string.

Be warned that the Kasiski text won't get you very far - you need to spend 
some time thinking up new ideas.
